## 4. User Responsibilities

4.1. **Data Accuracy:** You are solely responsible for the accuracy of all data you enter, including vehicle specifications, odometer readings, fuel entries, maintenance records, and financial transactions. The App performs calculations (fuel economy, costs, mileage deductions) based on user-entered data and does not independently verify this information.

- Distribute, sell, or sublicense the App or its content
- Use automated tools to access or scrape the App

## 5. Data Storage and Sync

5.1. The App stores data locally on your device using on-device storage. Cloud sync via Firebase Firestore is available for backing up and syncing data across devices.

5.2. Cloud sync occurs only when you explicitly initiate it or when network connectivity is available. The App functions fully offline using local storage.

5.3. In the event of sync conflicts, cloud data that is more recent will take precedence over local data.

5.4. We are not responsible for data loss resulting from device failure, App uninstallation, or circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

6.2. **Optional AI Features:** Receipt scanning using OpenAI's GPT-4o vision API is available as an optional feature. This requires you to provide your own OpenAI API key, which is stored securely in your device's Keychain. If the AI service is unavailable, the App falls back to on-device OCR processing.

6.3. Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices of third-party service providers.
